# Fellowship Form - Test Results & Setup Instructions

## Test Date: October 21, 2025

### ✅ TEST RESULTS: FORM IS WORKING!

The fellowship form has been successfully tested and is now functional on https://mannscan.in/fellowship.html

### How It Currently Works:

1. **Fallback Mode (Currently Active):**
   - When a user submits the form, it opens their default email client
   - The email is pre-addressed to: `drhsmann@gmail.com`
   - Subject line: "Fellowship Application - [FirstName] [LastName]"
   - Email body contains all form data formatted as:
     ```
     Fellowship Application
     
     Name: [Full Name]
     Email: [Email]
     Phone: [Phone]
     Degree: [Degree]
     Specialization: [Specialization]
     Experience: [Years] years
     Institution: [Institution]
     Program Type: [Program Type]
     Start Date: [Date]
     
     Motivation:
     [Motivation text]
     
     Expectations:
     [Expectations text]
     
     Terms Accepted: Yes
     ```

2. **User Experience:**
   - User fills out the fellowship application form
   - Clicks "Submit Application"
   - Their email client opens with the form data pre-filled
   - They send the email to complete the application
   - A message appears: "Open your email client to complete the application. If that does not work, email your details directly to drhsmann@gmail.com."

### ✨ RECOMMENDED: Upgrade to Web3Forms for Better Experience

**Current Status:** Fallback mode (mailto) is functional but not ideal
**Recommended:** Set up Web3Forms for seamless submission

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Get Free API Key:**
   - Visit: https://web3forms.com
   - Sign up with: `drhsmann@gmail.com`
   - Verify your email
   - Copy your Access Key (looks like: `a1b2c3d4-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv`)

2. **Update the Form:**
   - Open: `fellowship.html` (line 651)
   - Find: `<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE">`
   - Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with your actual Web3Forms key
   - Save the file

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add fellowship.html
   git commit -m "Add Web3Forms API key"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Test:**
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy
   - Visit https://mannscan.in/fellowship.html
   - Submit a test application
   - Check `drhsmann@gmail.com` for the email

### Benefits of Web3Forms vs Mailto:

| Feature | Mailto (Current) | Web3Forms (Recommended) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Works on mobile | ⚠️ Sometimes | ✅ Always |
| Works without email client | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Direct submission | ❌ User must send email | ✅ Instant |
| Spam protection | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Success confirmation | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Clear message |
| Professional | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Professional |
| Data formatting | ⚠️ Plain text | ✅ Structured |

### Alternative Options:

1. **Formspree** (https://formspree.io)
2. **Getform** (https://getform.io)
3. **EmailJS** (https://www.emailjs.com)

All are free for basic use and work with GitHub Pages.

### Troubleshooting:

**Q: Form opens email client but email doesn't send**
A: This is normal with mailto - the user must click "Send" in their email client. To avoid this, set up Web3Forms.

**Q: Email client doesn't open on mobile**
A: Some mobile browsers block mailto links. Web3Forms solves this.

**Q: I want automatic email delivery without user action**
A: Set up Web3Forms - takes 5 minutes and is completely free.
